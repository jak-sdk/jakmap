all the classes that make up the codebase should be represented here

any functionality that is at the spec level should live here

there are many functions that are decorated JMAP.abstract
    this means that this function should be implemented in a 'backend' 

e.g. backend/mysql/user,mailbox
     backend/local_files/account

backends are shadows of these files that actually know how to interface with reality

code in this directory should not know about reality.

(See comments at top of __init__.py about how we collide reality with spec)
