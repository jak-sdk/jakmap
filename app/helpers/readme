This is an assortment of 'helper' code.

Helper code is code that I didn't want to become boilerplate, so instead DRY it here.
These are global functions with no specific context.

Please treat anything being in this directory as a communication, from me to you, 
that I'm not particularly happy with it, but it was functionality that 
I needed at the time, so "just got it working" in here.

Nearly anything and everything in this directory is likely better implemented in a more structured, more extensible or more replaceable (deleteable) way, in some other directory.

examples at the time of writig this include output formatting and conditional logging.
